            <h2>Cali, Colombia</h2>
            <p>Cali, Colombia, known as the "Salsa Capital of the World," is a city where the rhythm of salsa music and dance is central to daily life and Colombian cultural identity. This lively heritage is matched by Cali’s unique cuisine, influenced by Afro-Colombian, indigenous, and Spanish traditions. Signature dishes like sancocho de gallina, a rich chicken stew with plantains, yuca, and corn, and pandebono, a beloved cheese bread, are staples that reflect the region’s agricultural bounty. Cali’s culinary and musical traditions together tell a story of a city that pulses with flavor and rhythm, deeply enriching Colombia's cultural landscape.</p>
