## Description
The midterm project is a restaurant website that showcases the fusion of my Colombian and Peruvian heritages. Drawing from my mixed cultural background, I have had the pleasure of enjoying both cuisines throughout my life, and this project reflects that blend of flavors and traditions. The website will feature three linked pages: an introduction page, a menu page highlighting various dishes, including a children's menu, and a creative page of my choice. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML and CSS while incorporating non-copyrighted images, lists, tables, and various linking methods.
